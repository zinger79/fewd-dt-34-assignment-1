<h1> Laura Zinger</h1>
<h3> Content Creator </h3>
<p> My last name isn’t <strong> Zinger </strong> for nothing. If you were to ask all of my previous employers to describe me, the first two things they would say are “energetic” and “creative,” and then they would tell you this: “Zinger is the most hyper-productive human being you will ever meet in your life.”

I have 15 years of experience in video production and editing (FCPX and Adobe Premiere Pro), and have produced, shot and edited everything from a feature length documentary to crowdfunding videos on the Indiegogo platform, raising a total of $45K combined and winning a spot on Indiegogo’s best pitch videos of 2012 list. I’ve contributed greatly to developing and creating content for two YouTube Channels at my two previous positions at the North American Spine Society (NASS) and The National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANAD), and am very happy to work in the web video/ YouTube Channel online spaces.

I also have over 15 years of experience in project management as a video producer, and 10 years of experience with office and business management that I gained while running a video production company and a national non-profit organization. </p>
